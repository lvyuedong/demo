# demo
Some python and C++ codes used for demonstrating the programming skill and code style. Those codes may not work directly as I deleted some proprietary codes from company.

stereoSafePlane
This is a Maya plugin for creating a stereoSafePlane object, which can be used to make stereo layout easily. This plugin was written in C++. There are also python scripts used to implement the plugin.
The python codes also demonstrate a playblast tool, merging left and right images.
There is a stereoCameraParalleView plugin which was used to display left and right viewport side by side in Maya. It was obsolete because it lost half resolution horizontally.

KatanaPythonUtilities
Python scripts used in Katana, help to do some routine task, for instance, set the light position and direction where the reflected ray and camera ray intersect at selected polygon face.

frustumSelection
A Maya plugin used to select visible objects through camera, written in C++.
